This study evaluates the out-of-sample performance of the Random Forest (RF) machine learning model in predicting non-compliance with quantitative performance criteria (QPCs) in International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan programs. The analysis focuses on 2,660 QPCs from 282 programs in 98 countries between 2003 and 2024, using data from the Monitoring of Fund Arrangements (MONA) database. The results show that the RF model outperforms traditional regularized logistic regression models outside the sample. In particular, the RF model has a weighted F1 score of 0.78 in predicting non-compliance with external targets and 0.79 in predicting non-compliance with targets by Argentina, the IMF's main creditor. The importance of a large number of variables and the presence of nonlinearities underscore the model's usefulness as a decision-support tool for IMF executive directors.
